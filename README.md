# 🛒 **Instacart Dataset Analysis**

This project delves into the anonymised **Instacart Dataset**, exploring customer behaviour, business insights, and machine learning applications. Through this repository, we aim to achieve the following:  
- 📊 **Studying the dataset** to grasp its structure and relevance.  
- 🛠️ **Cleaning and transforming the data** where necessary.  
- 🔍 **Conducting in-depth business analysis** to derive actionable insights.  
- 🎯 **Setting key performance indicators (KPIs)** to monitor and measure progress by segmenting subsequent data ranges, allowing for the evaluation of KPI predictions.  
- 👩‍💻 **Practising Git technologies** for efficient collaboration and version control (knowing more indept possibilities).  
- 🤖 **Training models**, including predictive algorithms and recommendation systems.  

### 💡 **Why This Project?**  
This is a hands-on opportunity to apply data science techniques in a real-world context, an interesting project to get our hands dirty. The use of "our" is intentional—you are invited to join the journey! Simply express your interest, and your contributions will be welcomed.  

📌 **Note**:  
This project is in its early stages, so expect ongoing updates. Once we wrap up, we’ll share detailed conclusions and challenges encountered during the process.

## 📖 **About the Dataset**
The dataset is sourced from **Instacart**, an American online grocery delivery service, and offers a fascinating glimpse into food consumption habits in the U.S. Released as *“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”*, it includes over **3 million orders** from more than **200,000 customers**.  

### 🧚‍♀️✨ **The Story Behind the Dataset**  
Instacart anonymised this dataset to protect customer identities while offering an opportunity for the machine learning community to experiment with real-world data. Each customer has between **4 to 100 orders** recorded, showcasing the sequence of products purchased.  

The aim is to encourage innovative solutions for:  
- Predicting items a user will **buy again**.  
- Recommending **new products** users might try.  
- Anticipating the **next items** a user might add to their cart during a session.  

Instacart uses cutting-edge technologies in its production system, including:  
- **XGBoost**: A predictive algorithm for item recommendations.  
- **word2vec**: An embedding model for product relationships.  
- **Annoy (Spotify)**: A tool for optimising "buy again" recommendations.
